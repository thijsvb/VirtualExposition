# App Manual

This is a user manual for the *Virtual Exposition* app.

After opening the app, you'll see two buttons.

*VR mode* and *Handheld*

If you want to use the app in a VR viewer, select *VR mode*. If not, select *Handheld*.

To see artworks, simply look at the pedestal and an artwork will appear. Be sure to walk around it and look at it from different angles,
to get the full experience!

But don't have the pedestal leave your field of view, because the app will lose tracking.
If this happens, simply take a step back to regain tracking.

**Enjoy!**
